# True Hourly Wage Calculator

A Python tool that figures out what you _really_ make per hour when you include all the hidden costs of getting to and from work.

## What It Calculates

### Your True Hourly Wage

This is the big number that matters. It's your take-home pay minus commute costs, divided by your work hours PLUS your commute time.

### Cost Breakdown

See exactly where your money goes:

-   Gas/Electricity/Transport fares
    
-   Parking and tolls
    
-   Total yearly commute costs
    

### Time Breakdown

How much of your life is spent on work-related activities:

-   Actual work hours
    
-   Commute hours
    
-   Total "committed" time per year
    

## Transportation Options

Types of commutes:

1.  **Driving (Gas Car)**
    
2.  **Electric Vehicle** 
    
3.  **Public Transportation** 
    

## How to Use It

 1.  **Run the program**: `python truecost.py`
    
 2.  **Enter your info**:
		 - Pay
		 - Work Schedule
		 - Commute Details
		 - Costs
3.  **Get your results**: See what you're really earning
    

## When to use this

Knowing your true hourly wage helps with:

-   **Job decisions**: Is that higher-paying job across town actually better?
    
-   **Budgeting**: How much are you _really_ spending to work?
    
-   **Life planning**: Is your commute eating too much of your time and money?
